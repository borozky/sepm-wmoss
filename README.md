## Manual testing? 

#### End-to-end tests
- End-to-end tests are difficult to write. I suggest don't do them. 

#### Regression Tests
- I suggest we do this after we have uploaded our code to a live server

#### Perfomance Tests
- You can log how log how long 'DOMContentLoaded' and 'Load' takes, and how many kilobytes each pages consumes. Check on 'Network' tab 'Chrome Developer Tools' for that.

#### Security Tests
- we don't know how to do security tests.

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Mostly done using a checklist
- I suggest also test on mobile devices.
